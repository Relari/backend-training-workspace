## RxJava 2 Course
ReactiveX is a combination of the best ideas from the Observer pattern, the Iterator pattern, and functional programming
* [ReactiveX](https://reactivex.io/)

### It has 5 operators which are:
* io.reactivex.Single: a flow of exactly 1 item or an error,
* io.reactivex.Maybe: a flow with no items, exactly one item or an error.
* io.reactivex.Flowable: 0..N flows, supporting Reactive Streams and backpressure
* io.reactivex.Observable: 0..N flows, no backpressure,
* io.reactivex.Completable: a flow without items but only a completion or error signal,
